# HARNESS EXPERIMENT REGISTER

**In-repo E-register for the CLAUDE.md Standard.** These are **OBSERVATIONS of one harness version**,
not documented mechanisms. Anthropic documents none of this; all of it is behaviour probed from
inside a session and may change without notice on any upgrade.

**Anchor:** all results below measured **2026-08-18**, Opus 5 via the Claude Code VSCode extension.
Exact CLI version string NOT captured (`claude --version` unavailable in the sandbox) — a re-run
should record it, because "which version was this true of" is the whole value of an anchor.

**RE-RUN TRIGGER:** on any Claude Code major-version upgrade, re-run **E1b** and **E2** *before*
trusting rule scoping or marker invisibility. Tracked as an OUTSTANDING item. Both findings are
load-bearing: E1b decides whether scoped rules are a control or a convenience, and E2 decides
whether the entire marker vocabulary costs context budget.

## E2 · Are HTML comments stripped before injection? — **ANSWERED: YES**

A canary token was planted in `CLAUDE.md` at one exact position — **between the `# Repository:` line
and the `---` that follows it** (record this; a re-run must plant in the same slot for the result to
be comparable). Then a session that had **demonstrably loaded the post-canary file** — it quoted the
new tier POINTER text and named commit `0bf57989` — was asked to reproduce the first 12 lines from
context.

It reproduced line 3 and then `---`, **skipping precisely the canary's five lines**, while
positively identifying both neighbours.

That positive ID either side is what makes the absence **evidential** rather than "didn't notice" —
a session that simply failed to recall the region would have been vague about the neighbours too.

**CONSEQUENCE:** `@enforced` / `UNENFORCEABLE` markers in HTML comments are **free**. The tagging
pass economy holds, and the always-loaded context ceiling legitimately excludes comments.

**Caveat:** placement-dependent. This tested a comment block between top-level sections. It does
**not** license the assumption that a comment in any position is stripped.

## E1b · Do scoped rules trigger on WRITE? — **ANSWERED: NO — READ-TRIGGERED ONLY**

Five probes, four rules, both directions, with a positive control:

| Probe | Rule expected | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Read** `lib/screening/…` | `fitscore.md` | **ARRIVED** |
| **Read** `lib/comms/delivery-notice-…` | `comms-urls.md` | **ARRIVED** |
| **Bash-edit that SAME comms file** | `comms-urls.md` | did not arrive ← *the A/B* |
| **Bash-edit** `lib/tier/…` | `billing-gates.md` | did not arrive |
| **Write NEW** `lib/offline/_probe.ts` | `inspections.md` | did not arrive |

The comms pair is the clean experiment: **one file, one rule, one variable** (read vs. write).
Everything else is held constant, so the difference is attributable.

**Scope of exposure.** The `Edit` tool **refuses to run without a prior `Read`**, so `Edit` can never
be the uncovered case. The exposed paths are exactly **Bash-mediated edits** and **`Write`-tool
creations** — which means coverage is roughly proportional to the care already being taken.

**Untested:** `Write` **OVERWRITING an existing** file (the probe created a new one). A re-run should
close this.

### ⚠ CONSEQUENCE FOR THIS REPO, AND IT IS NOT SMALL

All 18 rule files are scoped, so **all** path-scoped doctrine is absent from any session that writes
without reading first:

- `migrations.md` — 176 lines of amend-forward discipline
- `identity-scoped-tables.md` — the `org_id` exception + membership test
- `data-access.md` — the gateway rules

The spec said *do not move incident-class content to a scoped rule until E1b resolves.* **It has now
resolved AGAINST that, and this repo moved everything before the question was asked.**

**Rung 4 is a convenience layer for reading sessions, NOT a control.** Anything in a scoped file that
must hold regardless needs a **rung-1/2 twin** (a hook or a check). That twin audit is open work.

---

## E1 · Does `paths:` frontmatter defer loading? — **OBSERVED YES, not A/B tested**

Scoped rule files arrive mid-session on relevance, not at launch. This is **not** the controlled
cross-session A/B the spec specifies — treat as **suggestive**, not established. Distinguish it from
E1b, which *is* controlled.

---

## E3 · Does this file reach a subagent? — **OPEN**

Whether `CLAUDE.md` is injected into a spawned subagent's context. Unresolved. Bears on whether
delegated work inherits doctrine or must be handed it explicitly in the prompt.

---

## Why this file exists separately from CLAUDE.md

By E2's own finding, a register recorded in an HTML comment inside `CLAUDE.md` is **stripped before
any session sees it** — it instructs nobody. The findings are already load-bearing in the artefacts
themselves (E2 justified the marker format; E1b produced the twin audit, the SECURITY RULES
annotations, and the M-register), so the lab notebook does not need to travel with them.

What stays in `CLAUDE.md` is a two-line citation. What lives here is the narrative and the **re-run
protocol** — including the canary's exact plant position, which is re-run instructions and belongs
with the protocol rather than at the site being probed.
